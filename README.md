# Module 7 Week B — Integration Task: Summarization & Integrated Evaluation Report

This is the starter repo for the Module 7 Week B Integration Task. **The integrated evaluation report you produce here is the M7 deliverable.**

The full integration guide is at <a href="https://levelup-applied-ai.github.io/aispire-14005-pages/modules/module-7/496c1c2b" target="_blank">the integration guide page</a> — read it first.

## Model and Corpus

This integration uses **sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6** — a distilled version of BART fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail summarization corpus. It is a 6-layer encoder / 6-layer decoder transformer (~300 MB) that generates abstractive summaries via beam search with `num_beams=4` and `do_sample=False`. The model loads from Hugging Face Hub at runtime; no model file is committed to this repo.

The evaluation runs on **120 tech / entertainment news articles** from `data/tech_news_articles.csv` (1,033-article pool curated from glnmario/news-qa-summarization). Reference summaries are CNN editor-authored and ship in `data/tech_news_summaries_reference.csv`. To re-run the full evaluation: `make summarize`.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make summarize    # runs full pipeline; first run downloads ~250 MB
```

The first call to `pipeline("summarization", ...)` downloads the model. Plan ~3 minutes for the first run; subsequent runs use cached weights. The full evaluation on 120 articles completes in ~6–8 minutes on CPU after the model is cached.

## What you will produce

Committed:
- `summarize.py` — your implementation
- Updated `README.md` — 1–2 paragraphs documenting model id, corpus version, re-run command (this section is the template; replace it)
- `summary_predictions.csv` — 120 rows with reference, predicted, and per-summary ROUGE
- `summary_metrics.json` — aggregate ROUGE-1/2/L F1
- `integrated-evaluation-report.md` — six-section integrated report (the M7 deliverable). Includes an optional Section 7 (Challenge Extensions) for learners completing challenge tiers — see the integration's learner guide.

**No model file** — pre-trained model loads from Hugging Face Hub at runtime.

## Data

- `data/tech_news_articles.csv` — 1,033 tech / entertainment / digital-culture news articles, curated from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glnmario/news-qa-summarization" target="_blank">glnmario/news-qa-summarization</a>. The full pool is here for inspection and stretch use; the integration evaluates on the 120-article subset that has reference summaries.
- `data/tech_news_summaries_reference.csv` — 120 reference summaries (one per evaluated article), shipped with the curated dataset (CNN editor-authored summaries from the source dataset).
- `data/tiny_articles_smoke.csv` + `data/tiny_refs_smoke.csv` — 3-row CI smoke fixtures (articles and references in separate files, matching the real-data schema).

## Make targets

```bash
make summarize    # full pipeline against the 120-article evaluation set
make smoke        # CI-only target — 3-row fixture
make clean        # remove generated outputs
```

## Submission

Open a Pull Request from your working branch into `main`. The autograder runs `make smoke` against the 3-row fixture and validates artifact schemas. PR description requirements are in the integration guide.
